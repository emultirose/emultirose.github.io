```

And modify the theme in `hugo.toml`

```toml
theme = 'hugo-theme-reimu'
```

## Usage

<details>
<summary>Create Configuration</summary>

### Creating Configuration

#### Theme Configuration

Create a `_default` folder within the outer `config` directory, then copy `config/_default/params.yml` from the theme into this `_default` folder. This file serves as the theme configuration file, allowing theme settings to be modified.

#### Data Configuration

Copy all files from the theme's `config/data/` folder to the outer `data` folder. These files in the data folder are used to configure theme data:

- `covers.yml` to configure random cover images
- `friends.yml` to configure friend links
- `vendor.yml` to configure CDN sources for third-party libraries

#### Static Resource Configuration

Static resources for the theme (favicon, header images, etc.) are located in the `static` folder. You can create corresponding folders in the outer `static` directory and copy files from the theme to replace default files.

> In general, it is recommended not to modify the theme files directly. Instead, create corresponding folders in the outer directories and copy theme files into them to overwrite defaults. This makes upgrading the theme easier.

</details>
<details>

<summary>Basic Structure</summary>

### Basic Structure

To ensure correct display, refer to `_example` and create `archives` and `post` folders in the `content` directory (the `_index.md` inside cannot be omitted, and note that the `draft` in `post` is `true`)

#### archives

- `_index.md` used to display the archive page, cannot be omitted

#### post

Create articles in this directory, and note that articles with `draft` set to `true` will not be displayed on the homepage

- `_index.md` used to ignore the generation of `post/index.html`, cannot be omitted

#### about\.md

About page

#### friend\.md

Friend link page

</details>

<details>
<summary>Cover, Banner, and favicon</summary>

#### Cover

The logic for displaying the cover is as follows

- If the article's Front matter contains the url for cover, the article's header image and home page thumbnails display that url

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
cover: https://example.com
---
```

- If the article's Front matter contains cover as `false`, the article doesn't show the header image (it's still a random image on the front page)

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
cover: false
---
```

- If the article's Front matter contains cover as `rgb(xxx,xxx,xxx)`, the article's header image is the corresponding gradient solid color (still a random image on the front page)

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
cover: rgb(255,117,117)
---
```

- Otherwise, look for the `data` folder and `covers.yml` and pick a random image from it
- If none of these files exist, display the banner

#### banner

The banner is stored in `themes/hugo-theme-reimu/static/images/banner.webp` and can be modified in the `params.yml`

```yaml
banner: "images/banner.webp"
```

#### favicon

The icon is stored in `themes/hugo-theme-reimu/static/favicon.ico` and can be replaced by overwriting it

</details>
<details>
<summary>Code Block</summary>

### Code Block

To ensure that the code blocks are displayed correctly, please ensure that the `hugo.yml` is configured as follows

```toml
[markup.highlight]
guessSyntax = true
noClasses = false
```

The code block also provides a code paste function. Click the copy button in the upper right corner of the code block to copy the code. In the `params.yml`, you can configure the copy function.  
`success` is the prompt when the copy is successful, and `fail` is the prompt when the copy fails. In addition, you can configure the copyright statement. When the number of characters copied is greater than `count`, the content copied will be followed by the `content` copyright.

```yaml
clipboard:
  success: 复制成功(*^▽^*)
  fail: 复制失败 (ﾟ⊿ﾟ)ﾂ
  copyright:
    enable: false
    count: 50 # The number of characters when the copyright is displayed
    content: 本文版权：本博客所有文章除特别声明外，均采用 BY-NC-SA 许可协议。转载请注明出处！
```

v0.2.0 add configuration to control the default expansion status of the code block, `expand` can be set to `true`, `false` or a number, the number means that when the number of lines of the code block is greater than the number, it is collapsed by default.

```yaml
code_block:
  expand: true # true | false | number
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Site comments</summary>

### Site comments

> In-site comments can be controlled independently of each post using `comments` in Front matter.  
> Comments are not shown when `comments` is `false`, and are shown or not shown when `true` or not filled in, depending on the `_config.yml` configuration.

<summary>Site search</summary>

Based on [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), please add the following configuration in the outer `hugo.toml`

```toml
[outputs]
home = ["Algolia", "HTML", "RSS"]

[outputFormats.Algolia]
baseName = "algolia"
isPlainText = true
mediaType = "application/json"
notAlternative = true
```

This will generate an `algolia.json` file in the `public` folder for Algolia search. Then you can use plugins such as `atomic-algolia` to upload it to Algolia.

At the same time, change `algolia_search.enable` to `true` in the `params.yml` and fill in the relevant information (**Note! The Search-Only Key is filled in here, and the Admin Key is not allowed to be filled in! Otherwise, it may be attacked**)

```yaml

  enable: true
```

</details>
<details>

<summary>Mathematical formulas</summary>

### Mathematical formulas

Please add the following configuration in the outer `hugo.toml` first

```toml
[markup.goldmark.extensions.passthrough]
enable = true
delimiters.block = [["\\[", "\\]"], ["$$", "$$"]]
delimiters.inline = [["\\(", "\\)"], ["$", "$"]]
```

And add `math` as `true` in the Front matter of the article that needs to use mathematical formulas

```yaml
---
math: true
---
```

> Be careful not to enable KaTeX and MathJax3 at the same time

#### KaTex

If your math formulas are based on [Katex](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX), please change `math.katex.enable` to `true` in the `params.yml`

```yaml
math:
  katex:
    enable: true
```

#### MathJax3

If your math formulas are based on [MathJax3](https://www.mathjax.org/), please change `math.mathjax.enable` to `true` in the `params.yml`. And you can add configuration in `options` (since Hugo will automatically convert the key of the object to all lowercase, the configuration needs to be placed in an array to avoid the default behavior)

```yaml
math:
  mathjax:
    enable: true
    options: [{}]
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Mermaid</summary>

### Mermaid

Diagram based on [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/#/), please add `mermaid` as `true` in the Front matter of the article that needs to use the diagram

</details>

<details>
<summary>Icon</summary>

### Icon

Icon defaults to the iconfont provided with this project

```yml
icon_font: 4552607_tq6stt6tcg
```

If you want to continue using fontawesome icons, set `icon_font` to `false`, which will use the corresponding fontawesome in `vendor.yml`.

```yml
fontawesome:
  high_priority:
    - webcache|@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@6.5.1/css/regular.min.css
    - webcache|@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@6.5.1/css/solid.min.css

</details>


<details>
<summary>Customize theme</summary>


#### Customize theme color

hugo-theme-reimu supports customizing theme colors through CSS variables. You can customize your theme colors by modifying the CSS variables under the `:root` pseudo-class.

The variable file is located at `assets/css/_variables.scss`, where you can find all the CSS variables, but you only need to modify the variables under the following pseudo-classes:

```scss
:root {
  --red-0: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
  --red-1: hsl(0, 100%, 66%);
  --red-2: hsl(0, 100%, 74%);
  --red-3: hsl(0, 100%, 84%);
  --red-4: hsl(0, 100%, 91%);
  --red-5: hsl(0, 100%, 95%);
  --red-5-5: hsl(0, 100%, 96%);
  --red-6: hsl(0, 100%, 98%);

  --color-red-6-shadow: hsla(0, 100%, 65%, 0.6);
  --color-red-3-shadow: hsla(0, 100%, 65%, 0.3);
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  &:root {
    --red-4: hsla(0, 100%, 91%, 0.5);
    --red-5: hsla(0, 100%, 95%, 0.2);
    --red-5-5: hsla(0, 100%, 96%, 0.1);
    --red-6: hsla(0, 100%, 98%, 0.2);
  }
}
```

#### Customize theme font

You can define Google fonts through the following configuration:

```yaml
# https://fonts.google.com/
font:
  article:
    - Mulish
    - Noto Serif SC
  code:
    # - Ubuntu Mono
    # - Source Code Pro
    # - JetBrains Mono
```

v0.2.0 added the `local_font` configuration to define local fonts, which have a lower priority than Google fonts:

```yaml
local_font:
  article:
    - "-apple-system"
    - PingFang SC
    - Microsoft YaHei
    - sans-serif
  code:
    - Menlo
    - Monaco
    - Consolas
    - monospace
```

#### Customize theme icon

##### Header / Sidebar Icon

The structure of the `menu` configuration in v0.1.0 has changed, allowing users to customize the icon. When the icon is empty, the Taiji icon is used by default. You can fill in a hexadecimal number to customize the icon, and support fontawesome and icon font.

```yaml
menu:
  - name: home
    url: /
    icon: # if the icon is empty, the Taiji icon is used by default
  - name: archives
    url: /archives
    icon: f0c1 # You can fill in the fontawesome / iconfont icon code
  - name: about
    url: /about
    icon:
  - name: friend
    url: /friend
    icon:
```

##### Footer / Back to Top / Sponsor Icon

v0.1.0 add `icon` configuration to the `footer`, `top`, `sponsor` configuration for custom icons.

- `url` is the path of the icon, which is relative to the path of `css/style.css`, so you need to go up one level to find the images folder.
- `rotate` is whether to rotate the icon, the default is `true`.
- `mask` is whether to use the image as a mask (i.e., only display the outline of the png image), the default is `true`.

```yaml
footer:
  icon:
    url: "../images/taichi.png"
    rotate: true
    mask: true

top:
  icon:
    url: "../images/taichi.png"
    rotate: true
    mask: true

sponsor:
  icon:
    url: "../images/taichi.png"
    rotate: true
    mask: true
```

##### Loading Icon

v0.1.0 adds the `icon` configuration to the `preloader` configuration for custom icons. When the icon is empty, the default svg is used, which is inlined to ensure the loading speed of the first screen. You can fill in a link to customize the loading icon.

Do not use too large icons to avoid affecting loading speed.

```yaml
preloader:
  enable: true
  text: 少女祈祷中...
  icon: # if the icon is empty, the default svg is used, which is inlined to ensure the loading speed of the first screen. You can fill in a link to customize the loading icon, such as '/images/taichi.png'
```

##### Anchor Icon

v0.1.0 adds the `icon` configuration to the `anchor_icon` configuration for custom icons. When the icon is empty, the default `#` icon is used. You can fill in a hexadecimal number to customize the icon, and support fontawesome and icon font.

```yaml
anchor_icon: # if the icon is empty, the default # icon is used
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Vendor</summary>

The `vendor.yml` path is now composed of `:cdn|:package@:version/:file`, and `:cdn` can be configured in `vendor` itself. It currently comes with the following CDN sources:

```yaml
cdn_jsdelivr_gh: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ # github acceleration only
cdn_jsdelivr_npm: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ # npm acceleration only
fastly_jsdelivr_gh: https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/ # github acceleration only
fastly_jsdelivr_npm: https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/ # npm acceleration only
unpkg: https://unpkg.com/ # npm acceleration only
webcache: https://npm.webcache.cn/ # npm acceleration only
```

Users can switch between CDN sources according to network conditions.
